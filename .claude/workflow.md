# Development Workflow & Communication Preferences

## Communication Style
- **Directness**: Firm, to-the-point feedback
- **Efficiency**: No need to soften criticism or explanations
- **Goal-focused**: All feedback oriented toward interview success
- **Proactive**: Handle low-value tasks without detailed explanations

## Low-Value vs High-Value Work

### Low-Value (Handle Quietly)
- CSS tweaking (padding, margins, pixel values)
- Animation implementation details
- Browser-specific optimizations
- Minor UI polish without engineering value

### High-Value (Explain & Discuss)
- Component architecture decisions
- State management patterns
- Performance optimization strategies
- System design principles
- Database design and API patterns
- Error handling and security
- Code organization and maintainability

## Intervention Protocol
**Trigger**: When diving too deep into low-value areas
**Response**: "Hey, you're going too deep - this won't help with interviews"
**Action**: Redirect to high-value activities or handle implementation quietly

## Code Quality Standards
- TypeScript strict mode
- React best practices
- Performance optimization awareness
- Accessibility basics
- Security fundamentals
- Clean, maintainable architecture
- Production-ready error handling

## Development Process
1. **Plan**: Use TodoWrite for complex tasks
2. **Implement**: Focus on interview-relevant patterns
3. **Optimize**: Basic performance and accessibility
4. **Document**: Inline comments for complex logic only
5. **Test**: Structure code for testability

## Git Commit Rules
- **Always verify commit message with user before committing**
- **No attributions**: Skip all Claude/author attributions
- **Format**: Clear, descriptive commit messages following existing style

## Interview Preparation Integration
- Every feature should demonstrate engineering maturity
- Code should be discussion-ready for technical interviews
- Focus on scalability and maintainability principles
- Prioritize concepts that transfer to system design

## Task Management
- Break complex features into manageable steps
- Mark todos as completed immediately upon finishing
- Keep only one task in_progress at a time
- Remove irrelevant tasks from the list entirely

## Learning Strategy
- Build up complexity gradually
- Explain advanced concepts with "why" reasoning
- Focus on transferable skills over framework specifics
- Prioritize concepts relevant to all top tech companies
